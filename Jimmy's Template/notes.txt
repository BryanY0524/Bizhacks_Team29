demo

solution: 
ubuntu/windows aws to run python script from admin console, can upload to Firebase database/Github repo (best option if there are other things we need to run on ami)
raspberry pi (probably better solution, since its clunky and physical, but definitely doable)
django, host web app somewhere accessible
google compute engine (apparently free tier is fine if script is not CPU intensive apparently, so should be fine) https://cloud.google.com/free/

technology: requests, beautifulsoup4 (could use selenium if requests is blocked)
